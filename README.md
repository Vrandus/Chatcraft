# Chatcraft
Chat with Your Minecraft Server Through Discord!

## Intro
My friends and I wanted to play some minecraft, but it was hard to keep track of what went on in game and seeing who was online. So I created a discord bot that can be integrated into a Discord text channel that would relay the ingame chat to the channel and messages from the channel to the server.

**WARNING: This bot runs without any support for plugins/mods, which means the discord bot has to directly interact with your server console. This could pose a problem exposing your console.**
## Requirements
* Linux
* [A vanilla Minecraft server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) (probably also works on a modded server)

* [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)

* Cron
## Installation
